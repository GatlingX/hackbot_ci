## What's a Hackbot?

Gatling Gun is an upgraded fork of [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) a command-line tool that tests, builds, and deploys your smart contracts. 

It uses a different backend fuzzer to Foundry, and is designed to work with the Gatling Gun API.

You can use Gatling Gun CLI in your foundry based projects, and it will work with the Gatling Gun API. In particular, running `ggun test` should yield exactly the same results.
